1) Base on customer's descriptions, search for qualified items to purchase
2) Be able to find, compare and recommend deals
3) Have a secured way to store customer preferences and finanical information
4) The AI Agent should be able to finish a transaction with or without user interference

To do list:
1) Implement a chatbox type of frontend (like Amazon Alexa) with voice input capability
